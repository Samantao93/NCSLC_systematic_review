# Selection process for systematic review

- Results from the three databases were merged using the DOI URL as a common key, consolidating each record into a single entry.

- Data processing was performed in R (v4.4.1) with the dplyr package (v1.1.4).

- Records were filtered by document type to exclude nonâ€“peer-reviewed materials, including Meeting Abstracts, Patents, Preprints, Proceedings Papers, Conference Papers, Dissertations, and Theses.

- Review articles were also excluded to reduce redundancy, following best practices for systematic reviews.
